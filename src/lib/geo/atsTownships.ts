 * Alberta, identical for every user and every environment, so it has no
 * business in Supabase and would only make the mock provider lie.
 *
 * It is fetched the first time someone actually types a legal land description,
 * not on mount — most map sessions never use the lookup, and the map already
 * hydrates enough on load.
