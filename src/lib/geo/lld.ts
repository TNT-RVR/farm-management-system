/**
 * Legal Land Description matching. Pure functions — no React, no DB.
 *
 * An LLD under the Dominion Land Survey identifies a piece of prairie as
 * quarter–section–township–range–meridian: `SW-35-68-21-W4`. Everyone writes it
 * differently — `SW 35 68 21 W4`, `sw35-68-21w4`, `SW¼ 35-68-21 W4M`, or just
 * `35-8-21` when the quarter is obvious — and they are all the same place.
 *
 * ── Why substring matching is not enough ─────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * The field list matched with a plain lowercase `includes`, so a field stored
 * as `SW-35-68-21-W4` was found by typing `35-8-21` and NOT by typing
 * `SW 35 68 21`. Since the separator someone reaches for depends on whether they
 * are copying from a land title, a spray record or their own memory, that made
 * the search unreliable in exactly the case it exists for.
 *
 * Normalising both sides to `SW35821W4` before comparing fixes it, and costs
 * nothing for the other fields the same box searches.

 * trailing `M` in `W4M` — "meridian" is written with and without it and the two
 * mean the same thing. Anything else is left alone: this has to be forgiving,
 * not clever, because a wrong "helpful" transformation silently hides a field.
